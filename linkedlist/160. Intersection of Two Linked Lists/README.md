did not have idea in the first hand. Looked at solution. When impletemeting myself, first mistake is while loop, should also try recurssion. Next problem is the conditions in while loop, check node itself if its null instead of node next if it is null. Did not think trough the actual problem before writing code.

When writing c# code, always forget the ; at the end.

Prevant using if else, use more effecient expression.

When consider linkedlist problems in O(n) time, it does not mean we only need to triverse linkin list once. It is ok to triverse constant times of linked list, for example my solution to trough it two times and still consider constant time. Also keep in mind connecting linkedin list with each other can give different result.  May31
