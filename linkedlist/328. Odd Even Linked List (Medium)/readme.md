pretty straightforward logic. Had no trouble caming up \
when it comes to impletementing, did not consider edge case like next next null. \
Also make sure when writing while, first check if head is null then head.next is null\
also if checking while(head.next is null first, then head.next.next is null)
same for if else statement. Only previous node checked, then move on to next node.
