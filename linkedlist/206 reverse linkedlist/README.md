first impression have no idea. After look at idea, still not able to impletemented because I jumped in recurssion too quickly. First think about what recurrsion will return. The biggest mistake I made was confused by which head it would return, it supporse to return the last element as head but not the first. Secondly, did not consider base case. Have not try impletement while solution plus some extra, such as only reverse certain numbers of node

When review, try only inverse top n nodes.
