Start off went in wrong direction. A palindrome should be consistant in both way is the correct ways.\
to solve this problem. Once realize, have no trouble building a stack and compare both ways.\
Actually split in half is also doable. Use recurrssion and reverse the last half. \
to find middle element in a linkedlist, we can use middle= middle.next, end = end.next.next(stop when end is null or end next is null)
